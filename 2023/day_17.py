Because it is difficult to keep the top-heavy crucible going in a straight line for very long, 
it can move at most three blocks in a single direction before it must turn 90 degrees left or right. 

The crucible also can't reverse direction; after entering each city block, it may only turn left, continue straight, or turn right.
